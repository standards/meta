## Goals
The development world inside GitHub is vast and full of wonders, with lots people with different ways to conceive a piece of software. Open Source projects can present a huge challenge on how things should be done across scattered teams where common-knowledge distribution is a huge challenge on its own too.

Every developer comes from different background and can think of a solution in a number of different ways, but in order to be successful there are certain ground rules that should be put in place.

Being able to create something that followed pre-established conventions we can all agree on basically helps us:

* Measure quality in some way
* In case of software development, standards would assist a developer in understanding what a piece of software provides in order to facilitate usage
* Provide an understandable and universally accepted way to collaborate on any type of project
* Promote a healthy way to extend any project when collaboration guidelines are followed
* Bring up to speed new comers to a project being able to ramp up reading applied standards

In order to achieve such a level of expectation, let there be standards to help us. And in order to create a standard, its own standard should be complied.

## Definition
The following information should be added to your repository:

* Have a meaningful and short title and an accurate short description for your standard on the following form at the top of you `README.md` file:
  ```markdown
   ---
   title: Meta
   description: Standard to create GitHub Standards
   ---
  ```
  
The following sections should be added to the `README.md` file in order to shape a complete standard:

* **Goals:** This section should cover why the standard should exist. Always try to include the "A project compliant with this standard..." and examples of the resultant workflow of a compliant project.


* **Definition:** Which are the specific requirements that should be applied in order to be fully compliant. You can also point out optional requirements with a clear reference of why it is optional. At least there should be one compulsory requirement.


* **Resources:** Any reference to documentation used to create the standard as well as any appendixes. This is optional as there may not be any resource available to add.


* **Maintainers:** At least two people, with their correspondent email addresses, responsible for maintaining the standard. Also they could officiate as validators if no validator section is included. Refer to the [Learn section] of the Standards homepage to know more about validators job.


* **Validators:** It can be omitted if the people added as "Maintainers" are the ones responsible of fulfilling validators tasks. Otherwise, same requirements, at least two persons with their correspondent email addresses.

Any of these sections or additional subsections can be added as headers, sub-headers or lists as long the required information is included.

## Resources

* [Explore section] of the Standards homepage: Where you can explore all existing standards.
* [Learn section] of the Standards homepage: Information to understand how you can submit a new standard, propose changes to existing ones or request validation for applied standards on your projects.
