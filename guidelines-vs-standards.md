# Guidelines vs. standards appendix

## Guideline
> A piece of advice on how to act in a given situation.

* Recommended but non-mandatory, meaning that you can either adopt it or not, having the option to ignore it and end up with the problems associated with that approach that I mentioned in the previous slide
* Guidelines are not measured, you can’t really measure guideline adoption that effectively because some recommendations could have not been adopted so it would be pretty difficult to assign a level of adoption

## Standard
> Common format accepted and used by a group of people.

* A project complies with a standard or it doesn’t, there is no room for doubt. If a standard says what needs to be adopted and it is not, then you don’t comply with it and some guidance could be given to help on the missing points.
* Enables interoperability, as when a project complies with a standard you know what you are going to get from it, and if you don’t you have a very established documentation to learn what you are going to get

In a few words, its level of commitment provides assurance.

## GitHub Standard
* Not mandatory: No one is going to force you onto anything. If you want to comply with a standard, you will be welcomed. Each of us need to see value in it and that depends on each of us to make something valuable with the initiative.
* Gather Multiple points of view are considered and discussed: Healthy discussion where people can disagree with something and come with constructive criticism, suggestions and arguments, eventually figuring out the best solution.
* Hopefully after that process a consensus is reached and then documented
* Ideally a standard would be tool-friendly to get automatic help to comply with it

And of course a GitHub Standard should be widespread, otherwise this could happen:
